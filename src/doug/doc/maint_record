    map.c, map.1
	diagnostics include a version identifier.

    lambert.c
	Correct erroneous limit when standard parallels coincide.
	Problem noted by alex.deckmyn@oma.be.  Reject the limiting
	case of both standard parallels approaching the south pole.
	(Not easy to do right in the existing libmap framework.)
Dec 17, 2003
    ascii2map, map2ascii
	Add programs for converting between binary and ASCII map data.
        Make corresponding changes to manual, makefile, and README.
Nov 13, 2003
    man pages 
	A Makefile in the doc subdirectory supplies some extra 
	macro definitions beyond the usual -man macros.  This
	trades away prettiness for robustness--assuming you have
	groff.

    map.c
	Option -b: check that next argument exists before trying to
	look at it.  Stop accepting -b 0 as synonym for naked -b.
    eisenlohr.c
	New projection.
    zcoord.c, homing.c, map.h
	Make trigclamp() global in zcoord.c rather than static
	in homing.c.
    zcoord.c, elliptic.c
	Apply trigclamp() to defend against sin and cos outside [-1,1].
	Problem noted by minka@stat.cmu.edu.
    map.h, map.c, symbol.c, zcoord.c, aitoff.c, gilbert.c, hex.c, homing.c
	Rename sincos as trig to avoid collision with nonstandard
	but ubiquitous math-library function.
    hex.c, tetra.c
	Fix initialization to make projections serially reusable.
	Problem noted by minka@stat.cmu.edu.
    Makefile, map.sh, map.c
	Rework macro and environment names for consistency and simplicity.
    Makefile
	Some simplification and robustification.
    README
	Revisions for clarity and currency with other changes.
	Correct the usage of gv.
	Describe the "route" program.
    map.1
	Add eisenlohr; delete duplicate description of gilbert.
